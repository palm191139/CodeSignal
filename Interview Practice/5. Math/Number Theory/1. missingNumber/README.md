# missingNumber

You are supposed to label a bunch of boxes with numbers from 0 to n, and all the labels are stored in the array arr. Unfortunately one of the labels is missing. Your task is to find it.

### Example

For arr = [3, 1, 0], the output should be

missingNumber(arr) = 2.

### Input/Output

* [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)
* [input] integer year

    * An unsorted array consisting of different integers from 0 to n inclusive, with only one of them missing.

    * Guaranteed constraints:
        * 1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000,
        * 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.length.

* [output] integer

    * The missing number.
